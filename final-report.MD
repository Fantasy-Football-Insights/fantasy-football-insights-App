## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Document Purpose
The purpose of this document is to recap our fantasy football app project. We will review what our plans were and what we actually accomplished. In addition, we will examine the issues we faced and how we dealt with those issues. Finally, we will provide the links to our GitHub repository where our code is stored. 


## 2. What we Planned To Do
### 2.1 Our Plan
The initial plan for our application was to create a fantasy football application that predicted the best possible fantasy football team based on the user's draft position. In doing this, we wanted to develop an algorithm that took the average fantasy rankings of various sites and utilized those averages to construct the best possible team based on what position the user prioritized. In addition, we wanted to develop a trade analyzer that assisted users in constructing trades that would be fair and benefit their team. Furthermore, we intended to be able to predict the best lineup for each week based on each player's matchup for that specific week. 

## 3. What we Accomplished
### 3.1 Accomplishments
While we unfortunately did not accomplish everything we had set to develop in our application, we did manage to complete most of our plans. We were able to develop a working algorithm where users can input the size of their league, their draft position and the position they prioritize with their first pick to predict the best possible team based on those inputs. We were also able to get a working login and registration screen, with functioning logout and delete account features as well. We were able to get some functionality of a trade analyzer as well, but it is not the state we wanted it to be in. Overall, we accomplished much of what we planned and hope to continue to refine the application after the semester is over. 

## 4. Issue Overview
### 4.1 Issues we Encountered
We faced many issues throughout production of our application. These include: 
- Working with a new language (Typescript), framework (React Native) and development environment (Expo) for the first time.
- In the frontend, creating components for specific functions and working to combine each component as needed. 
- Making calls to the API from the frontend, specifically generating the correct fetch sequence.
- Developing an algorithm was challenging at times, specifically determining the best possible factors to include.
- Creating unit tests were also challenging as nobody had much experience creating tests or working with API's.
- Version control became an issue at times if we forgot to pull or push changes made.
 
### 4.2 How we dealt with Issues

## 5. Project Links
We stored all of our code in two GitHub repositories. One for the App portion of our project and another for the API portion.
